v1.0.0

> Backup the Jawbone UP

## Usage

`ACCESS_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_SECRET node index.js`

The client secret is associated with an app that you register at https://jawbone.com/up/developer/

The access token needs to be generated using OAuth 2.0. The easiest way to get this for a quick backup is using the [Jawbone UP API console](https://apigee.com/jawboneapi/console/UP).
